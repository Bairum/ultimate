 * Whether a model error is a rate limit Pi retries: HTTP 429, "rate limit", "too many requests". Retrying sooner only
 * hits the limit again, so Ultimate pauses until the user presses Play, and the held run continues through Pi's retry.
 * Quota, usage-limit and billing errors are on Pi's no-retry list: they end the run at once and fail as usual.
 * Overloaded servers (529) are the provider's capacity, not the account's limit.
