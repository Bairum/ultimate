description: Run a preview round for UI work that lands only with the user's approval (polish, a new card, a panel, anything the task says to preview first). Use when a branch must show the user a running preview, collect approval, and only then workspace submit.

# A preview round

UI polish lands only when the user approved it on a running preview. Checks, a review or your own screenshots are not
approval, and one approval covers one round.

1. **Commit the round** in your branch. A preview runs your checkout as it is on disk; committing keeps each round
   recoverable.
2. **Start the preview**: `instance start` (or `instance start {subagent: <id>}` for a designer's worktree). It is a
   clean Ultimate with its own empty home, every agent on `instance.model` (Sol, fast); it hot-reloads `web/` and `extensions/` as files
   change. A change in `server/` or `shared/` needs `instance stop` and a new `start`.
3. **Seed it like a user**: open @ultimate (the first row of the sidebar) and send real prompts until the state the user should
   judge exists: a long transcript, a running tool, a skill run, an error. Never fake state by writing entries.
4. **Look first yourself**: follow the `verify-ui` skill. Fix what is off before you ask anyone.
5. **Ask for approval**: while @ultimate's message to you is open (your task or a later question), your answer is
   the request; otherwise `message` @ultimate with reply: true. To send screenshots, `message` it with
   `images: "latest"`: to an open message that is your answer and ends your run. Include the URL (the tailnet URL when the preview chip shows
   one), what changed, a short numbered "what to try" naming the conversation you seeded, and a `Decisions:` block
   (approve as is, or change something).
6. **Iterate**: each change is a new commit and a new round; keep the same preview running.
7. **On approval**: remove anything only the preview needed, `instance stop`, then `workspace submit` with the
   divergence. Report the landing to @ultimate with reply: false.
