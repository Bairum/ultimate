Ultimate's awareness of its own code: the replay-safe `restart` tool requests a type-checked core swap from the supervisor (`pnpm start`). Failed preparation returns diagnostics while the old core continues. The tool saves the next generation before activation; replay reports the running generation or activation rollback.

Call after authorized changes to `server/` or `shared/`. Never call for `web/`, `extensions/`, or `agents/`: those reload without a core swap.

An isolated conversation must first land into the running Ultimate clone. Restart requires that clone to be clean and its HEAD to equal the workspace's saved landed commit; otherwise it asks you to land first. A shared conversation, including one in a project subdirectory, uses ordinary restart behavior.

Restart affects all conversations. Landing never restarts automatically. `POST /api/restart` requests the same swap; reconnect to `/api/events` to observe readiness.

`web.tsx` renders restart results, build information, and transcript reload markers. While `server/` or `shared/`
changed since this core booted, the status line shows `core changed · restart` just left of `live · gen N`; clicking
it restarts the host, and a failed restart turns it into `restart failed` with the reason in a popover.
When Vite applies a hot update without reloading the page, a quiet toast above the bottom right of the status line
names the modules it re-ran for 3 s; updates arriving meanwhile join it. Tailwind's stylesheet, rebuilt on every
source change, is named only when nothing else changed.
