/**
 * Dream before compaction: when @ultimate's context passes 70%, it writes a handoff while it still remembers everything,
 * then a dream starts by itself once nothing else works; once that dream settles, Ultimate falls asleep into a fresh
 * chapter only when it was worth it. The user's Dream button takes the same path: handoff first, then the dream.
 *
 * The trigger is an ordinary context automation, "Dream before compaction", that dream creates once per chapter, so the
 * user sees it in the Automations panel and can pause, delete or re-threshold it like any other. It subscribes
 * @ultimate: its fire is the input that asks for the handoff. Its fires reach dream as `automations.fired`; only a fire
 * of this automation, checked by its id in dream's own document, records a `waiting` request and starts the wait, and
 * the wait starts a session only through `startDreamIn`'s own refusals. The user-only `start` stays user-only.
